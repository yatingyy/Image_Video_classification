This is the project for image classification and Video classification. In this project, I did:
• Conducted data exploration, preprocessing, and image augmentation on image dataset using Keras and Python
• Performed transfer learning with pre-trained models ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16
• Employed moving averages over predictions to improve the reliability of video classification
• Evaluated the model performance on both datasets with Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1 score
